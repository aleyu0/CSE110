Hi, my name is Alessio and Iâ€™m currently a second-year undergraduate majoring in **Computer Science & Engineering at UC San Diego**. 

## Personal interests
I'm Chinese by heritage, Italian by upbringing, educated in the United Kingdom, and now chasing knowledge in sunny San Diego. I love travelling and seeing what the world has to offer. Being raised in a restaurant-owning family, I also have a strong interest in tasting new cuisines and dishes! During my free time, I like to design, graphic design to be specific. I find it very cool how little components clashed together can form aesthetic masterpieces. 

## About me as a programmer
My coding experience started from when I was in ninth grade. The computer science class in my high school sparked my interest in problem solving and creating tools and toys for the world. My programming journey started primarily with Web Development. However, this is just the starting point, I wish to explore more fields within Software Engineering.
